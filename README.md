# Pentest&amp;Python
Github repository for my work on college project Pentest&amp;Python

Everything posted here is tested on latest Kali Linux and ALFA AWUSO36H wireless card.

<b>GOAL</b> is to make a Wifiphisher script working on hardware noted above

Pingy - simple ping that scans range 192.168.1.100-110 (TODO: select range /w Scapy)

Wifi_scan - scaning nearby networks (w/ Scapy)

Client_scan - shows clients connected to AP(s) around you (w/ Scapy)

Basic_deauth - deauthenticates user on chosen network around you (w/ Scapy)

fake_ap - trying to replicate airbase-ng functionality with Scapy, but I'm not working on this currently <STUCK>

main_script.py - main work, this script will contain full functionality (Scapy + airbase-ng)

(more to come)
