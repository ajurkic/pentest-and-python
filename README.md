Everything posted here is tested on latest Kali Linux and ALFA AWUSO36H wireless card.

<b>GOAL</b> is to make a Wifiphisher script working on hardware noted above

Pingy - simple ping that scans range 192.168.1.100-110 (TODO: select range)

Wifi_scan - scaning nearby networks with scapy

Client_scan - shows clients connected to AP(s) around you (working on it...)

Basic_deauth - computer deauth not working, else works

(more to come)
